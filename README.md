# Udemy-Course
This is the repository for my Udemy Course 'Learn Python Programming Master Class'. It starts at section 3 and I'll be updating it as I keep learning and completeing it. Decided to start using github when starting the 9th section of the course.
Hello my name is Mitchell, I am currently learning Python with plans to learn javascript next. I'm really enjoying learning to program!
